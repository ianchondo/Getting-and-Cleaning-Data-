Getting and Cleaning Data :: Project This README file explains what the anaylsis files:

1.	Obtain the file and unzip the data 
    from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
    and rename the folder "UCI HAR Dataset".
    
2.	Make sure the current working directory is the correct one in R and R studio getwd() and github.

3.  Read the files, identify the data that needs to be merged, merge the data, obtain the means 
    and standard deviations for each measurement and create a tidy data set "tidyData.txt", which is a 
    table with 180 rows, 6 activities and 30 individuals (subjects).
